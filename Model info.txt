The model is built using a Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with cosine similarity as the distance metric. Here’s a quick breakdown:

TF‑IDF Vectorization:
The recipe ingredients (converted into plain text) are transformed into numerical feature vectors using TF‑IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Nearest Neighbors Algorithm:
The Nearest Neighbors algorithm (from scikit-learn) is then used to find the recipe whose TF‑IDF vector is closest (based on cosine similarity) to the vector of the user-provided ingredients.

This approach is a content-based filtering method that retrieves recipes similar to the input ingredients without relying on class labels.
